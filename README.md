# Rauff Hakeem Project

Our (Sri Lanka's) beloved City Planning and Water Supply minister Rauff Hakeem sometimes releases statement like
"I would develop this [city name] like [a developed country name]" and after a while people stop taking it seriously.
So I thought why should not I create an interactive map and rename those cities with country names. I will add 
more details soon (or not).
